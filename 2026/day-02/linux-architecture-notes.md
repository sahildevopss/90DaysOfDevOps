##Core Components of Linux

1. Kernel
- The kernel is the heart of Linux which controlls everything.
- It directly communicates with hardware.

Responsibilities:
Process management
Memory management
Device management
File systems
Networking

- Kernel is written in C to interact with it we need something i.e. SHELL

2.SHELL 
- A shell is a program that allows users to interact with the Linux operating system using commands.
- It acts as a bridge between the user and kernel.
- The shell takes your command,understands it and asks kernel to perform the action

Example
When you type: ls

The shell:
Reads the command
Finds the ls program
once found the shell asks the kernel to start program.
Program genrates o/p
Displays the output

3. User Space
Area where users and applications run.
Includes:
Shell (bash)
Commands (ls, ps, top)
Applications and services

4. Init / systemd
First process started by the kernel (PID 1).
Responsible for starting and managing services.

5. Processes
Every running program in Linux is a process.
Each process has:
PID (Process ID)
Parent process
Memory allocation
CPU usage

Common Process States
Running (R) → actively using CPU
Sleeping (S) → waiting for an input
Stopped (T) → paused manually or by signal
Zombie (Z) → completed but waiting for parent cleanup
Idle → not currently executing

6. Linux Commands Used Daily
Command	                            Purpose
ps aux	                        View running processes
top or htop	                    Monitor CPU & memory usage
systemctl status <service>	    Check service status
journalctl -u <service>	        View service logs
kill <PID>	                    Stop a process
